# Artificial Neural Networks
These form the basics for Deep Learning. The reporsitory contains many examples. We would first look into why Deep Learning is preferred by comparing different types of problems(Regeression, Binary Classification, Multi Class Classification). Later we will also see examples of ANN Models on MNIST Data and Fashion Images dataset. Stock Price prediction can also be done with ANN, we will examine this and we would also get some relavant data from internet and check if that helps our case.
