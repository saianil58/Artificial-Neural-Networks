# Artificial Neural Networks
These form the basics for Deep Learning. The reporsitory contains many examples. We would first look into why Deep Learning is preferred by comparing different types of problems(Regeression, Binary Classification, Multi Class Classification). Later we will also see examples of ANN Models on MNIST Data and Fashion Images dataset. Stock Price prediction can also be done with ANN, we will examine this and we would also get some relavant data from internet and check if that helps our case.
## Implementation:
Basic implementation with detailed steps are [Here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/saianil58/Artificial-Neural-Networks/blob/master/Multiclass%20Classification/Multi_Class_classification.ipynb) and this notebook is using IRIS dataset which most of us dont need any introduction.

## Case Studies:
### Regression Model:

### Binary Classification:
HR Analytics dataset, to predict the employees who will stay in orgnization. [Here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/saianil58/Artificial-Neural-Networks/blob/master/Binary%20Classification/binary_classification_keras.ipynb) is the notebook with details of the implementation.
ANN performs better than Logistic Regression Model.

### Multi Class Classification:

## Identify the Digits:

## Identify the apparels:

## Stock Market Predictions:
